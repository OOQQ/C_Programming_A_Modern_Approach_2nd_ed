=======================================
Write a program that asks the user to enter a series of ints. (stored in an array), the sorts the integers by calling the function _selection_sort_. When given an array with n elements _selection_sort_ must do the following:

1. Search the array to find the largest element, then move it to the last position in the array.
2. Call itself recursively to sort the first n-1 elements in the aray.
